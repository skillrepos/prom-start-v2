# Getting Started with Prometheus - lab setup

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs. If you prefer, and you understand how to install and use the applications, you can install them locally and clone the repo. But the instructions in the course and labs will reference the codespace environment setup.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting the actual labs.

<br/><br/>
## 1. Create your own codespace to run the labs by clicking on the button below.
<br/><br/>

Click here ------> [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/prom-start-v2?quickstart=1)

<br/><br/>

Then click on the option to create a new codespace.

**This will run for several minutes while it gets everything ready.**

<br/><br/>


## 2. Start the Kubernetes cluster and install the apps needed
There is a script file in [**extra/install-apps.sh**](./roar-k8s/install-apps.sh) :

    - Run the following commands in the codespace's terminal (**This will several minutes to run and you can ignore any WARNING messages or Error from server (NotFound) messages - these are expected.**):

      ```
      extra/install-apps.sh
      ```

    - The output should look similar to the following.

```console

## 3. Open the labs

You can open the file **labs.md** in a separate browser session outside of your codespace or directly in your codespace. 

To open it in your codespace, after the codespace has started, open the labs document by going to the file tree on the left, find the file named **labs.md**, right-click on it, and open it with the **Preview** option.

![Labs doc preview in codespace](./images/promstart58.png?raw=true "Labs doc preview in codespace")

This will open it up in a tab above your terminal. Then you can follow along with the steps in the labs. 
Any command in the gray boxes is either code intended to be run in the console or code to be updated in a file.

Labs doc: [Getting Started with Prometheus Labs](labs.md)

**Now, you are ready for the labs!**

**4. (Optional, but recommended) Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer (60 for half-day sessions, 90 for deep dive sessions).**
To do this, when logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and scroll down on that page until you see the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

![Changing codespace idle timeout value](./images/gaidd4.png?raw=true "Changing codespace idle timeout value")

**NOTE: If your codespace times out and you need to restart it**

1. Click on the *Restart* button
2. In the terminal, run the *extra/restart.sh* script

If, for some reason, you lose the tab with the codespace

1. Go to https://github.com/your_github_userid/codespaces
2. Find the codespace in the list, right-click, and select *Open in browser*
3. In the terminal, run the *extra/restart.sh* script
